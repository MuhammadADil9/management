1st way
as soon as a task will be inserted
it will be saved into database and similarly in a array
it will then pop up the task window prompting the user to inser the valid points. 
which will be savedinto database mapped with the parent/main task. 
they will be then assigned a time.
Each as soon as the time ends for a task it will be popped out of the array.
The next task will start, unless or untill not stopped by the user itself.


2nd way

it will be saved into database and similarly in a array
then the points or description will be inserted into it. 
which will be savedinto database mapped with the parent/main task.

Each as soon as the time ends for a task it will be popped out of the array.
The next task will start, unless or untill not stopped by the user itself.
